# Discordarr
Python script that will scan the movie database for upcoming movies this month and allow you to add them right to radarr from discord

A discord bot that once added to your server will allow you to run commands
1. ?checknew (shows all movies that are upcoming this month)
2. ?getmovie tmdbid (will add it to your radarr instance)
3. ?checktoprated (shows all top rated movies)
4. ?checkpop (get all popular movies as per tmdb)
5. ?checknowplaying (get all movies in theater)

Still in development
